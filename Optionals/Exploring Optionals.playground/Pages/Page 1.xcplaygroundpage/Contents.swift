 ## Variable initialization
 
 What is the difference between an optional String and a regular String?
 
 Try typing the following code into the playground:
 
 ![declare-no-value](declare-no-value.png)
 
 Run the playground.
 
 What is the result?
 */
// Type the code below this line
var myName : String?
print(myName)

/*:
 
 Open the debug area by pressing **Command-Shift-Y**.
 
 Scroll up to the top of the output.
 
 You should have seen output similar to the following:
 
 ![variable-not-initialized](error.png)
 
 Now revise your code above, and change it to the following:
 
 ![declare-with-value](declare-with-value.png)
 
 Run the playground again.
 
 How does the result differ?
